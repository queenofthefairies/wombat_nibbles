# Wombat data analysis and visualisation code snippets
These scripts are NOT a cogent python package but rather a starting point for basic data analysis and making plots quickly. Some scripts are also applicable to data from Echidna. 

The powder data reduction routine developed by James Hester for Echidna and Wombat is described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576718014048) and the current Wombat powder data reduction routine is available from the [Gumtree/Wombat_scripts](https://github.com/Gumtree/Wombat_scripts) github repository.

## List of scripts

- `image_of_Wombat_detector_from_txt_file.py`. Input: a txt file with 3 columns: Y, X (two theta), intensity. Output: a plot of the detector image.     
- `XYE_sum.py` Sums GSAS-II xye files together.
